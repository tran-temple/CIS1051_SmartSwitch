# CIS1051_SmartSwitch
Smart Switch is a final project for the CIS1051 (Introduction to Problem solving and Programming in Python) class.

# 1. Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I had three following ideas: chatbot, tic tac toe game and smart switch. I discussed two ideas (chatbot and tic tac toe game) with the TA, and he suggested that I should add more small features to make it amazing. After Professor talked about sample projects and Raspberry Pi, I had the third idea and decided that I will do a smart switch with my available Raspberry Pi Zero device (for instance, implementing for this device to turn on / off the light). I will be deploying a web (in Python) on this Raspberry Pi Zero device to control the light.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will work on my own for this final project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Currently, I think that it is an interesting project. I am waiting for Professor's approval.

## Updated: The Professor approved it. The next part will be a proposal write-up.

# 2. Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will be Smart Light Switch.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be a simple web page with buttons to turn on / turn off the light, and this light will be connected to the Raspberry Pi Zero device.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Firstly, I will have the Raspberry Pi Zero device and install OS on it. Secondly, I will create a simple web page in Python, and then deploy it on the Raspberry Pi Zero device. Finally, I will connect a light to the Raspberry Pi Zero device. The user can login the web on computer or smart phone (using local network) to turn on / off that light.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Currently, I am not planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project. My major is IS&T. I am in the last semester and almost done all classes to graduate. I chose this course when I am interested in applications for Python. The course is very valuable. Additionally, I would like to do this project to gain knowledge and teach my young kids about STEM subjects in the future.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am planning to work on my own. If I meet any trouble, I will ask or discuss with the TA - Sai Shi (Email: sai.shi@temple.edu)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
I know that there is always different between what will be proposal and what will be implemented perfectly. In order to accomplish, it often takes longer to implement as our expectation; however, I believe that I can do this final project the best when I am active learning and researching.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-	A simple and user-friendly web page
-	The Raspberry Pi Zero device and the light connected properly
-	Users only run the web on their computer or smart phone (using local network) to turn on / off the light quickly and efficiently

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

My proposal project is a small, fun and interesting project. I work it solo, and so I think that I can accomplish before the final project's deadline.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It will be “Users only run the web on their computer or smart phone (using local network) to turn on / off the light quickly and efficiently”

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The below is steps as well as skills that they will help me complete my final project:
-	Prepare the Raspberry Pi Zero device and the light (I am already done)
-	Install OS on the Raspberry Pi Zero device
-	Design a simple web page (I had basic knowledge when I completed the Web Client Scripting course at Temple)
-	Foundations of Python Programming (I am learning in this CIS-1051)
