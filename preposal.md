# Preposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I had three following ideas: chatbot, tic tac toe game and smart switch. I discussed two ideas (chatbot and tic tac toe game) with the TA, and he suggested that I should add more small features to make it amazing. After Professor talked about sample projects and Raspberry Pi, I had the third idea and decided that I will do a smart switch with my available Raspberry Pi Zero device (for instance, implementing for this device to turn on / off the light). I will be deploying a web (in Python) on this Raspberry Pi Zero device to control the light.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will work on my own for this final project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Currently, I think that it is an interesting project. I am waiting for Professor's approval.

## Updated: The Professor approved it. The next part will be a proposal write-up.
